# oc-browser/themes
Themes are a great way to customise your browser. They add colour and allow special formatting.<br>
Please note that themes are mandatory. The browser will use Default Dark automatically.

## Installation
You can edit the browser directly and make your own theme.<br>
Or, you can copy one of the lua files in this directory.
