Themes are a great way to customise your browser. They add colour and allow special formatting.<br>
Please note that themes are mandatory.

## Installation
You can edit the file directly and make your own theme.<br>
Simply copy the matching file into the same directory as the browser, and edit the file's name to `theme.lua`.
